# GraphQL Client for Locust

Locust is a python performance test library. Locust supports http client out of the box.
This library provides the GraphQL Client for Locust.

This GraphQL Client is based on Prisma's Simple GraphQL Client for Python (https://github.com/prisma/python-graphql-client)

# API

```python
class GraphQLClient:
 def execute(self, label, query, variables=None, type ='graphql'):
```

####Arguments
* type = Locust Request Type. Default value is 'graphql'
* label = Locust Name
* query = GraphQL Query
* variables = GraphQL Variables. Default value is None


# Usage

```python
from locust import TaskSet, task
from locustgraphqlclient import GraphQLLocust


class UserBehavior(TaskSet):
    def on_start(self):
        """ on_start is called when a Locust start before any task is scheduled """
        self.login()

    def on_stop(self):
        """ on_stop is called when the TaskSet is stopping """
        self.logout()

    def login(self):
        query = '''
        mutation login($username: String!, $password: String!) {
          login(username: $username, password: $password) {
            access_token
          }
        }'''
        variables = {
            'username': 'gm',
            'password': 'centric8'
        }
        result = self.client.execute("login", query, variables)

        # Inject the Access Token in the Client, so subsequent requests can be made
        self.client.inject_token(result['data']['login']['access_token'])

    def logout(self):
        # Reset the Access Token in the Client, so no subsequent requests can be made
        self.client.inject_token('')

    @task(2)
    def index(self):
        query = '''
                    query products {
                      products {
                        id
                        name
                        image
                      }
                    }'''
        result = self.client.execute("products", query)

    @task(1)
    def profile(self):
        query = '''
                    query me {
                      me {
                        id
                        username
                        firstName
                        lastName                    
                      }
                    }'''
        result = self.client.execute("me", query)


class WebsiteUser(GraphQLLocust):
    endpoint = "/graphql"
    tasks = [UserBehavior]
    min_wait = 5000
    max_wait = 9000
